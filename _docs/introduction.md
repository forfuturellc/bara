# Introduction

Transport Notification Service (TNS) is a web service that offers public data
 concerning transport routes.

The service consumes user-generated relevant data. This data may further
 be used to generate statistics.


## Usage

Users subscribed to the service may be alerted of events occurring that
 concern transport routes of interest to them. Information used to
 generate such events may be collected from different sources. The
 service may consume public data sources, such as Twitter. Users may
 also push data to the service.

With this data, users may make informed decisions on what routes are
 best for use. It may also be used to analyse transport systems and help
 make decisions on where needs improvement.


## Actors

Main actors in this service include:

* transporters
* consumers


### transporters

These include any party, individual or organisation, managing large number
of vehicles. _Large_ here is subject to opinion. They may then be grouped
differently according to the locality of the transport system.

For example, in a country like Kenya, transporters may grouped into either
_public_ or _private_ transporters. These _public_ transporters may then be
grouped into _saccos_ that each manage a number of public service vehicles.


### consumers

These are entities that retrieve data from the service. This may include
 the public (human users) and other web services. For the case of web
 services, it remains the responsibility of the consumer to make meaning
 of the data in their context.

Public use, or rather human users, may require the service to provide the
 data in a more sensible manner. For such a tasks, web/client applications
 may be required.
