# Introduction

Transport Notification Service (TNS) is a web service that offers public data
 concerning transport routes.

The service consumes user-generated relevant data. This data may further
 be used to generate statistics.


## Usage

Users subscribed to the service may be alerted of events occurring that
 concern transport routes of interest to them. Information used to
 generate such events may be collected from different sources. The
 service may consume public data sources, such as Twitter. Users may
 also push data to the service.

With this data, users may make informed decisions on what routes are
 best for use. It may also be used to analyse transport systems and help
 make decisions on where needs improvement.
